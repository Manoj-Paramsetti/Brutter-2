about:
 It will show a short description of this script

generate:
 It will start your work
 Further input is provided in the square bracket so, check that and give the write option to generate success. I'm a lazy guy so, not able to explain more.

help:
 It will show this message again so, Don't execute it once again. It's not a bug. it is a feature
